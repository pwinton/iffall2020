                                        Plants have long been used in perfumery as a source of essential oils and aroma compounds. These aromatics are usually secondary metabolites produced by plants as protection against herbivores, infections, as well as to attract pollinators. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="font-size: 10pt;">Plants are by far the largest source of fragrant compounds used in perfumery. The sources of these compounds may be derived from various parts of a plant. A plant can offer more than one source of aromatics, for instance the aerial portions and seeds of coriander have remarkably different odors from each other. Orange leaves, blossoms, and fruit zest are the respective sources of petitgrain, neroli, and orange oils.
                                    </p>

                                        Ambergris is made of oxidized fatty compounds, whose precursors were secreted and expelled by the sperm whale. Because the harvesting of ambergris involves no harm to its animal source, it remains one of the few animalic fragrancing agents around which little controversy now exists. Castoreum is obtained from the odorous sacs of the North American beaver. Also called civet musk, civet is obtained from the odorous sacs of the civets, animals in the family Viverridae, related to the mongoose.

                                    <p style="font-size: 10pt;">Both beeswax and honey can be solvent extracted to produce an absolute. Beeswax is extracted with ethanol and the ethanol evaporated to produce beeswax absolute. Musk is originally derived from a gland located between the genitals and the umbilicus of the Himalayan male musk deer, it has now mainly been replaced by the use of synthetic musks sometimes known as “white musk”.</p>

                                        Synthetics can provide fragrances which are not found in nature. For instance, Calone, a compound of synthetic origin, imparts a fresh ozonous metallic marine scent that is widely used in contemporary perfumes.

                                        Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate source of compounds that are not easily obtained from natural sources. For example, linalool and coumarin are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from terpenes. Orchid scents (typically salicylates) are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match the fragrant compounds found in various orchids.
