My name is Penelope Winton and I'm a junior in Sam Fox studying Communication Design and Art History.
Having the tools to code and construct web pages is more important than ever, and happens to coincide with my area of study. I'm glad that my major is pushing me out of my comfort zone to actually take a course in web design.
